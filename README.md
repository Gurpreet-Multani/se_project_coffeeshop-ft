# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the fulltime Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

A quick idea maybe I could update the background with better images.add more animation to the background with index to make background appear like a gif partially.
